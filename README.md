# sql-challenge

Collaborated with Lucinda and Frewoini. Dallin helped Frewoini with the initial relations, my instinct originally was to have one manager per department but that was off. 

Utilized stackoverflow examples as well as PostgreSQL documentation. Specific links commented in the .sql files. 

Challenge referenced bonus content but I didn't see any so I just followed what was requested.
